#[Hello, World] To-Do List

The [Hello, World] To-Do List is an interactive scheduler that allows users to see their to-do lists day by day. Each user has a unique account that keeps track of their to-do list items and presents it in both a list form and a dynamic pie-chart seperated into different categories defined by the user. The user will have the option to add and delete categories to their to-do list items based on their changing needs from day to day. They will also be able to add and remove items on their to-do list as they complete them. 

Based on the categories the user assigns to each item, the pie chart will change based on the percent of their time usage. 

The [Hello, World] To-Do List is a fun and interactive web app to help individuals keep better track of their responsibilities.
